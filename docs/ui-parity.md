# UI parity

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-22 · **Change:** minor (distinct polyline midpoint grips) · **Target:** Autodesk AutoCAD 2027 for Mac (26.0)

How CADCraft's interaction compares with AutoCAD's: point entry, object snaps, tracking, dynamic
input, grips, selection, the command line, chrome and navigation. A drafter's speed in AutoCAD
comes from these, so "the command exists" isn't enough: it has to accept the same input, snap to
the same points and respond to the same keys. Work items: [gaps.md](gaps.md#uiux).

**Headline (estimated): UI/UX fidelity ≈ 48%.** The command line, point syntax, the common
running snaps, polar/ortho, object snap tracking and the palettes are real, and so are the
Extension, Parallel and Apparent Intersection snaps (#379); dynamic input is a read-only
tooltip; FROM, M2P, TK and point filters don't exist; hot-grip options are advertised but
ignored; there are no context menus. Remaining: **≈ 110–170 Opus 5.5 hours**.

## How this was measured

- CADCraft: read from the source on 2026-10-10 (main at bd2412f): `crates/engine/src/{prompt,
  snap, select, grips, lib, units}.rs`, `cmd/*`, `crates/ui-egui/src/*`. Not run in this pass.
- AutoCAD: behaviour observed black-box in the running AutoCAD 2027 for Mac
  (`plan/autocad/01-observed-ui.md`, local only, with reference screenshots that are never
  committed), its menu tree (`xtask/data/menu-catalog.txt`) and Autodesk's documentation.
- Weights (how often a drafter hits each area): point entry 15%, object snaps 15%, tracking and
  polar 10%, dynamic input 10%, grips 10%, selection 10%, command line 10%, chrome and palettes
  10%, navigation 5%, keyboard and context menus 5%.

| Area | Weight | CADCraft | Weighted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Point entry | 15% | 45% | 6.8 |
| Object snaps | 15% | 45% | 6.8 |
| Tracking, polar, ortho, grid/snap | 10% | 70% | 7.0 |
| Dynamic input | 10% | 45% | 4.5 |
| Grips | 10% | 40% | 4.0 |
| Selection | 10% | 40% | 4.0 |
| Command line | 10% | 60% | 6.0 |
| Chrome and palettes | 10% | 45% | 4.5 |
| Navigation | 5% | 55% | 2.8 |
| Keyboard shortcuts, context menus | 5% | 25% | 1.3 |
| **Total** | 100% | | **≈ 48%** |

## Point entry (≈ 45%)

| Input | AutoCAD | CADCraft | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x,y[,z]`, `@dx,dy`, `@d<a`, `d<a`, `#x,y`, bare `@` | yes | yes; `#` equals absolute because there is no UCS; Z parsed then discarded | `prompt.rs:147-180` |
| `*x,y` (WCS override) | yes | yes (`*x,y`, `*@dx,dy`, `@*dx,dy`); the same as the plain forms because there is no UCS | `prompt.rs` |
| Direct distance entry | yes, honours ortho, polar and tracking paths | yes, ortho; polar only through the UI's snapped cursor | `lib.rs:782-793` |
| Angle forms: `45d30'`, radians, grads, surveyor `N45dE` | yes | yes | `units.rs:141-197` |
| Architectural/engineering distances `5'6-1/2"` | yes | yes | `units.rs:93-140` |
| `FROM` (base point + offset) | yes | yes: "Base point:", "<Offset>:" with `@` measured from the base; nests with M2P and filters | `pointmod.rs` |
| `M2P` / `MTP` (midpoint between two points) | yes | yes | `pointmod.rs` |
| `TK` (tracking) | yes | **no** | |
| Point filters `.x`, `.y`, `.xy`, `.z` | yes | yes (`.x` … `.yz`, "(need YZ):"); Z is asked for and dropped (no 3D) | `pointmod.rs` |
| Angle override `<45` | yes | yes: `<a`, `<<a`, `<<<a`; a typed distance or a pick follows the angle, typed coordinates win | `pointmod.rs` |
| Object snap overrides (`END`, `MID`, `INT` … `NON`) | yes | yes, every mode and `NON`, with long names and `_`/`'` prefixes, for the next pick only; a typed point is snapped within the aperture; a command's own keyword wins (`_cen` always snaps); also from the snap menu | `pointmod.rs` |
| Typed calculator `'CAL` | yes | no | |

## Object snaps (≈ 45%)

| Mode | AutoCAD | CADCraft (`snap.rs:135-334`) |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint | every curve, solid/3D vertices, dimension ends | lines, arcs, polyline segments, open ellipses and splines, ray base, solid/trace corners |
| Midpoint | every curve incl. ellipse/spline arcs, polyline segments | segments only; **none on circles, ellipses, splines** |
| Center | arcs, circles, ellipses, polyarcs | arcs, circles, ellipses |
| Geometric center | any closed polyline, spline | closed LWPOLYLINE only |
| Node | points, dimension definition points, text alignment points | POINT only |
| Quadrant | circles, arcs, ellipses | yes |
| Intersection | every pair, extended intersection | among up to 200 nearby primitives; ellipse/spline pairs approximate ([geometry-parity.md](geometry-parity.md)) |
| Extension | yes, with dashed extension path | yes: rest on a line or arc end, then the line runs on (a ray) and the arc round its circle; dotted path and "Extension: d < a°" (`snap/tracking.rs`); not from ellipse, spline or polyline-arc ends |
| Insertion | text, mtext, blocks, attributes, attdefs | TEXT, MTEXT, INSERT; no ATTDEF or MLEADER |
| Perpendicular | every curve, deferred | lines, arcs, circles, xlines; deferred for the first point (#168) |
| Tangent | circles, arcs, ellipses, splines, deferred | arcs and circles; deferred for the first point; **no ellipse or spline** |
| Nearest | every curve | yes |
| Apparent intersection | projected intersection | yes in 2D: where objects near the cursor would meet if extended; an object rested on sends its whole extension, so its crossing with another object snaps too (`snap.rs` `osnap_with`, `snap/tracking.rs`) |
| Parallel | yes, with parallel path | yes: rest on a line, then a path parallel to it runs through the base point (`snap/tracking.rs`) |
| Temporary overrides typed at a prompt (`END`, `MID`, `INT` …) | yes | **no**: the text arrives as plain input |
| Shift/Ctrl+right-click snap menu | yes | yes: From, Mid Between 2 Points, Point Filters, the snap modes, None, Osnap Settings; no Temporary track point yet (`context_menu.rs`) |
| Tab to cycle candidate snaps | yes | yes, through the closest snap of each running mode under the cursor (`pointmod::snap_candidates`) |
| AutoSnap marker, tooltip, magnet, aperture box | yes | marker per mode and name label; aperture from APERTURE; no magnet, no aperture box |
| OSNAPZ, 3D object snaps | yes | no |

## Tracking, polar, ortho, grid and snap (≈ 70%)

| Feature | AutoCAD | CADCraft |
|---|---|---|
| Ortho (F8) | yes, Shift overrides it while held | yes; holding Shift turns it on or off while held (`Session::snap_cursor`, `snap/tracking.rs`) |
| Polar tracking increment | yes | yes, measured from ANGBASE; dotted path and "Polar: d < a°" tooltip (`snap/tracking.rs`, `canvas.rs` `draw_tracking`) |
| Additional polar angles, relative to last segment | yes | additional angles yes (POLARADDANG with POLARMODE 4); **relative to the last segment no** |
| Polar distance snap (PolarSnap) | yes | **no** |
| **Object snap tracking** (acquire points, alignment paths, intersections of paths) | yes, F11 | yes (#379): resting on a snap point acquires it (`+`), resting again releases it, seven at most; horizontal/vertical paths, or every polar angle with POLARMODE 2; Shift to acquire with POLARMODE 8; crossings of two paths, a path and an object, and a path and a polar path snap; tooltip names each path; a typed distance (direct distance entry) runs along the path the cursor is on, measured from the point the path comes from. Engine: `Session::snap_cursor`, `snap/tracking.rs`; AUTOSNAP bits 8 and 16 |
| Grid (rectangular, major lines, adaptive, limits) | yes | rectangular and isometric (30°, 90° and 150° lines), major lines, adaptive display |
| Snap (rectangular, isometric, polar snap) | yes | rectangular and isometric (SNAPSTYL 1: the snap Y spacing along the isometric axes), from SNAPBASE turned by SNAPANG |
| Isometric drafting (ISODRAFT, isoplanes F5) | yes | yes (#556): ISODRAFT and the status-bar toggle set SNAPSTYL and the plane; ISOPLANE / F5 / Ctrl+E cycle Left, Top, Right (SNAPISOPAIR); ortho, direct distance entry and the crosshair follow the plane's axes; ELLIPSE Isocircle (radius or Diameter, also for elliptical arcs); Drafting Settings snap style radio. Engine: `snap/iso.rs`, `cmd/settings/iso.rs` |
| Drafting Settings dialog | yes | yes (`dialogs.rs:36-80`) |
| Hatch and Gradient / Hatch Edit dialogs | yes | yes (`hatchdlg.rs`): pattern swatches, gradient colours and shapes, origin, pick points or objects, associative, separate, island detection; Hatch Edit adds boundaries from points or closed objects and removes selected loops; opened by HATCH, GRADIENT (HPDLGMODE), HATCHEDIT, right-click or double-clicking a hatch; no Preview or Inherit Properties |

## Dynamic input (≈ 45%)

AutoCAD's heads-up input (F12) has editable pointer-input fields (x, y), dimensional input
fields (length and angle) with Tab between them and lock icons, relative-by-default second
points, dimensional input on grips, a prompt with clickable options and a down-arrow menu.
CADCraft has pointer input boxes since #60 (`crates/ui-egui/src/dyninput.rs`): value boxes
beside the cursor while a command asks for a point; second and later points default to polar
distance and angle (DYNPIFORMAT = 1 for Cartesian); `,` and `<` lock a value and move to the next
box; Tab types the separator; Enter sends a relative entry (DYNPICOORDS = 1 for absolute) and
fills an empty box from the cursor; a plain number stays direct distance entry. Missing:
dimensional input on grips (length/angle fields while stretching), lock icons, the prompt with a
down-arrow options menu (DYNPROMPT), and DYNDIM.

## Grips (≈ 40%)

  are missing.
- Delete erases the selection on macOS (#64); Escape cancels.
- Right-click on the canvas is Enter while a command runs; holding it (250 ms, AutoCAD's
  time-sensitive right-click) opens the command menu: Enter, Cancel, Recent Input, the prompt's
  options, Snap Overrides, Pan/Zoom. Otherwise it opens a shortcut menu (Repeat, Recent Commands,
  Clipboard ▸, Isolate ▸, the selection's editing commands, Draw Order ▸, Group, the selected
  object type's edit commands, Select Similar, Deselect All, Undo/Redo, Pan/Zoom; #325, #512).
